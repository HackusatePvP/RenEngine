# RenEngine
This is the engine that was yanked out of RenJava. During the process of 'yanking' it out it lost a lot of cool features and functionality. This is what RSDK-GUI uses, but I do not recommend using it for your own applications.

## NOT MAINTAINED
This will hardly receive updates and when it does it's for RSDK-GUI. The engine will be coded to work for that singular application. Any additions fixes or removals are for the betterment of RSDK-GUI.

### Issues
Please do not report issues with this project. It's unfortunately at the bottom of my priority. I know some people would be excited to have a simpler JavaFX engine, but I just don't have the time.
